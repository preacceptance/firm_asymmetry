Am I the same person I was before despite changing so much? I've never found a good answer. In my opinion, this is a semantic problem, language that is. Language is subjective and words can possess multiple true definitions. ""Same"" is the issue here. Without a qualifier like ""absolutely"", ""physically"", or ""morally"" attached to the word ""same"", there is no qualification for what is to be considered the ""same"". So, in essence, a company could be logically considered the same in a variety of ways and/or not considered the same in a variety of ways. It's too complex of a question with too many answers to provide an absolute yes or no answer. It is and it isn't the ""same"". This is all irrelevant to myself though, as change is the more appropriate question when evaluating such a phenomenon. Did they change enough? How did they change? Is the change enough to inspire forgiveness in myself? Did the change occur too late? Similarities and differences can sometimes be more accurately measured by change over time rather than static states or periods of differing levels of sameness. Think of it as the difference between heat and temperature. Sometimes heat is much more applicable than temperature in applying that information to other aspects of our lives.","cmc_8","In the present day, some companies sell a mixture of products made from cheap and uninspected materials and products made from quality and properly inspected materials.
