## Firm Asymmetry GitHub

Data and code for firm asymmetry project.

All works out of the box except e5a_twitter_followers, which has large files. See our OSF repository for this. In it, we have two sub folders:

- `api_code` - pull tweet mentions on different entities from the internet. Note: you will need your own API key to run this code. 
- `analysis` - analyze these tweet mentions by averaging them and performing a few simple calculations (anova and t.test) to understand the different types of tweet sentiment for each type of entity
